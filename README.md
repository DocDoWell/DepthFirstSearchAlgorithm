# DepthFirstSearchAlgorithm

Two depth-first search graph algorithms. One uses recursion, whereas the other uses a stack data structure.

Graph is a composition representation where a vertex object references it's neighbour vertices (that is, the vertices to which it is connected by an edge) with in itself.
